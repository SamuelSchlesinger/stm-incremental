# Revision history for stm-incremental

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-10-14

* First version of stm-incremental was put together, tests are satisfactory
and ironed out a few corner cases which had bugs. Now, the recursive updates
seem to be working, and we can use this to basically write materialized views
in Haskell code.
